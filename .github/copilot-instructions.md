# Gunnar Glasses Discord Chatbot

## 🧠 Pro## 📝 Dev Notes
- **Architecture**: Use .NET Aspire for orchestrating all services and dependencies
- **Modular Design**: Separate message handling, embedding logic, and Qdrant queries
- **Ollama Integration**: Use local Ollama models for generating embeddings and AI responses
- **Service Discovery**: Leverage Aspire's service discovery for connecting to Qdrant and Ollama
- **Rich Messages**: Use `EmbedBuilder` for Discord rich embeds
- **Analytics**: Log user queries for future training or analytics
- **Brand Voice**: Keep responses concise, friendly, and brand-aligned with Gunnar's tone
- **Local Development**: Ensure Ollama is running locally for embeddings and inferenceOverview
